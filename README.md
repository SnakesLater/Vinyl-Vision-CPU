# Vinyl-Vision 🎵

Drop an album cover photo → get artist, title, Discogs metadata, pricing, and AI-generated notes — all cataloged locally.

## How it works

```
You snap a cover photo → CLIP (embeddings) → Qwen 3.5-9B (vision LLM)
  → MusicBrainz (release lookup) → Discogs (metadata + pricing)
    → Saved to your local catalog
```

Three layers of matching:
1. **CLIP** — instant re-match if you've already cataloged this cover (local embedding index)
2. **Qwen 3.5-9B** — reads the cover art and identifies artist, title, year, label, genre, and writes a fun info blurb
3. **MusicBrainz + Discogs** — enriches with release details, market pricing, tags, and Discogs links

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.14**
- **LM Studio** with **Qwen 3.5-9B** (the vision model) loaded, API server enabled on port `1234`
- **Discogs API token** (free — sign up at [discogs.com/developers](https://www.discogs.com/developers))
- **HuggingFace token** (free — needed to download the CLIP model)

## Quick Start (native)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set your API tokens
export DISCOGS_TOKEN="your_discogs_token"
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"

# 3. Make sure LM Studio is running with Qwen 3.5-9B on port 1234

# 4. Start the app
python main.py

# 5. Open http://localhost:8081
```

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
export DISCOGS_TOKEN="your_discogs_token"
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"
docker compose up -d
```

The container uses `network_mode: host` so it reaches LM Studio on `localhost:1234`. Your catalog data lives in `./catalog/` and `./images/` on your machine.

## Use it from your phone

1. Connect your phone to the same WiFi as this computer
2. Find your computer's LAN IP (`ip addr show` on Linux)
3. Open `http://<YOUR_IP>:8081` in Safari or Chrome
4. Tap the drop zone → take a photo or choose from gallery

## View logs

All logs print to the terminal where you ran `python main.py`. Watch it live to see LM Studio responses, MB search results, and any errors.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "LM Studio not running" | Start LM Studio, load Qwen 3.5-9B, enable API server on port 1234 |
| "No matches in MusicBrainz" | Try a clearer photo — Qwen needs to read the text on the cover |
| Permission errors on catalog/ or images/ | `sudo chown -R $(whoami) catalog/ images/` |
| 500 error on upload | Check the terminal log for the specific error |

## Tech Stack

| Component | Model/Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Vision LLM | **Qwen 3.5-9B** (via LM Studio) | Reads album cover, extracts artist/title/label, generates info commentary |
| Image embeddings | **openai/clip-vit-base-patch32** (via HuggingFace transformers) | Visual similarity search + ranking |
| Music metadata | **MusicBrainz API** | Release lookup, cover art via Cover Art Archive |
| Marketplace data | **Discogs API** | Pricing, tags, genre, format, label, barcode |
| Image processing | **Pillow** | Image handling |
| Frontend | **Vanilla HTML + JS** | Drag-and-drop (or tap-to-photo) interface |
